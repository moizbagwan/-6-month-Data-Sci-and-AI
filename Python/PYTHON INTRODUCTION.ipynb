    "# PYTHON INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is Python ?\n",
    "- ans : Python is highly recommended programing language \n",
    "\n",
    "- Father of Python : GUIDO VAN ROSAM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python came from fun tv show called \"Complete Monthly Python \"\n",
    "- python borrowed all concept from c,c++, java,unix (python is everything) thats why . python very very powerful tool\n",
    "- python develope in NRI - (Netherland) & lot of people say that python is new language\n",

    "\n",
    "    * Now python is very popular based on software industry requirment because everybody wants to write very less code/concile code\n",
    "    * Current market trend is- Machine learing, Artificial intelligence, data science & Iot(Internet of things)\n",
    "    * which companies are used python - google,nasa,uber,netfliz,reddit,facebook/meta, everywhere python used everywhere\n",
    "    * python code can understand everybody & python is dynamic programming language\n",
    "    * In python everything done by PVM (python virtual machine)\n",
    "    * you can access python in any platform independent- windows, linux, mac one code can run in all the 4 platform & no need to      write separate programe for every platform. Once you write code you can run in platform\n",
    "    * Python is dynamically programming language (not required to declared data types)\n",
    "    * Python is freeware and open source. Moving from one platform to other platform without changeing any code\n",
    "    * Python contains rich libray - numpy,pandas so python is the best application for datascience\n",
    "    * which scenario python can't be used - ( python can not perform in mobile application like android )\n",
    "    * Flavours of python - cpython(C programming),jpython(java programming),Iron python(c#.net),Ruby python(Ruby based application  programme),Anaconda python(Bigdata,datascience)\n",
    "    * Python 1.0 introduce in jan 1994 -- Noorganization is working now\n",
    "    * Python 2.0 introduce in oct 2000 -- Noorganization is working now\n",
    "    * Python 3.0 introduce in Dec 2008, 2016, 2017,---- latest version - 3.6, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10"
