    "# Overfitting & Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting**\n",
    "- Overfitting happens when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, which makes it perform poorly on new (unseen) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Simple Words:**\n",
    "- Model performs excellent on training data but bad on testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- If a student memorizes all the answers from a practice test instead of understanding the concepts â€” he will score high on that test but fail on a new one.\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dataset  | Model Accuracy        |\n",
    "| -------- | --------------------- |\n",
    "| Training | Very High (e.g., 98%) |\n",
    "| Testing  | Very Low (e.g., 60%)  |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causes:**\n",
    "- Model is too complex (too many parameters/features)\n",
    "- Not enough data\n",
    "- No regularization used\n",
    "- Too many epochs in training (for neural networks)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions to Avoid Overfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use more training data\n",
    "2. Simplify the model (reduce features or layers)\n",
    "3. Regularization (L1, L2, Dropout)\n",
    "4. Cross-validation\n",
    "5. Early stopping (for deep learning)\n",
    "6. Pruning (for decision trees)\n",
    "7. Use dropout / noise injection\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underfitting**\n",
    "- Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to learn the underlying patterns in the training data.\n",
    "- It performs poorly on both training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Simple Words:**\n",
    "- The model hasnâ€™t learned enough from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- If a student doesnâ€™t study properly, he will fail both in practice tests and real exams.\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s underfitting.\n",

    "| Dataset  | Model Accuracy  |\n",

    "| Training | Low (e.g., 60%) |\n",
    "| Testing  | Low (e.g., 55%) |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causes:**\n",
    "- Model is too simple (e.g., linear model for nonlinear data)\n",
    "- Too few features\n",
    "- Too much regularization\n",
    "- Insufficient training\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solutions to Avoid Underfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increase model complexity\n",
    "(e.g., use polynomial regression or deeper network)\n",
    "2. Add more relevant features\n",
    "3. Reduce regularization\n",
    "4. Train longer (more epochs)\n",
