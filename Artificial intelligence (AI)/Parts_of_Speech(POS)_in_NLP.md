# üß† Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging in NLP

### üìñ Description  
Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging is a fundamental step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** where each word in a sentence is assigned a specific grammatical label, such as **noun**, **verb**, **adjective**, etc.  
It helps machines understand the **structure**, **meaning**, and **context** of human language.

In NLP, POS tagging is commonly performed using libraries like **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**.  
Each tag represents the word‚Äôs grammatical category ‚Äî for example:  
- `NN` ‚Üí Noun  
- `VB` ‚Üí Verb  
- `JJ` ‚Üí Adjective  
- `RB` ‚Üí Adverb  

These tags are used in many NLP tasks such as **text classification**, **sentiment analysis**, **chatbots**, and **information extraction**.
